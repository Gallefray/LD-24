cos(angle) = xVelocity
sin(angle) = yVelocity
if you have an angle and a velocity, the resultant vector would be (xVel * cos(angle), yVel * sin(angle))

First, you get the vector from the circle to the player, IE newVector = playerPosition - circlePosition. 
Then you normalize said vector: newVector = normalize(newVector). 
Now you got the direction vector from the circle towards the player. 
You can now increment the current circle position with the direction vector: circlePosition += newVector
You can even make it go faster or slower by using circlePosition += newVector * speed, where speed is a float.
